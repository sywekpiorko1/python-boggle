    The 'search' start to search by passing single position to a 'do_search', this is a path of one letter, the 'do_search' converts whatever path is given into a word and checks if it's in dictionary.
    If a path makes a word it's added to a paths list. Whether the path is word or not 'do_search' gets each of neighbours of last letter, checks that neigbouring letter is not already in a path and then continues the searching from that letter.
